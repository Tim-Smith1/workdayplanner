# workdayplanner

In this Work Day Planner
you will be able to type in important events and the click the save button to the right of your hour block.

For your convience we have a live clock and date. 

We have also color coded the hours so you know what hour you are on (red)
what events will happen in the future (green) and finally the items in the past are in gray.
